The company Megaline (telecom operator) offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. It is necessary to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. There is data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Main research objective is to study clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
